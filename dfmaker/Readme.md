# `dfMaker`

`dfmaker` is a functions which allows `OpenPose` massive data structuring  and also it provides the possibility of obtain `CSV` files for further analyses.



### Function atributes

dfMaker(video.folders = "/home/user/outPutOpenPoseFolder/",save.csv = TRUE,output.folder = "/home/user/saveHereCSV",
         return.empty = TRUE)
         
    

# `fast.mode`


The data structured by `dfMaker` can be in one `CSV` file, if it was manually saved, or in several `CSV` files generated by `save.csv`. The second case needs to load and assemble the data and the loading time is bigger, but sometimes is better to have a file for subset isntead of just a full set.


fast.mode(fast.mode = `FALSE`, path = "/home/user/filesCSV/")

fast.mode(fast.mode = TRUE, path = "/home/user/filesCSV/dataSet.csv")
