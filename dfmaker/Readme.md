## Function atributes

dfMaker(video.folders = "/home/user/outPutOpenPoseFolder/",save.csv = TRUE,output.folder = "/home/user/saveHereCSV",
         return.empty = TRUE)
         
    
`video.folders`: Path to `JSON` files generated by `OpenPose` from videos.

`save.csv`: Boolean variable to save the output (`TRUE`/`FALSE`).

`output.folder`: In case `save.csv = TRUE` a path to save files must be provide.

`return.empty`: Boolean variable to get empty frames. It generates a list with the video's name and the number of empty frame.
    

# `fast.mode`


The data structured by `dfMaker` can be in one `CSV` file, if it was manually saved, or in several `CSV` files generated by `save.csv`. The second case needs to load and assemble the data and the loading time is bigger, but sometimes is better to have a file for subset isntead of just a full set.
