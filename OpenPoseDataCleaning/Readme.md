The data generated by `dfMaker` is raw data, which means `dfMaker` only structures the data from `OpenPose` but statistics treatment is needed. Here some functions are presented as tool to make statistics treatment of `OpenPose` data.



# `fast.mode`

The data structured by `dfMaker` can be in one `CSV` file, if it was manually saved, or in several `CSV` files generated by `save.csv`. The second case needs to load and assemble the data and the loading time is bigger, but sometimes is better to have a file for subset instead of just a full set.

### Function atributes

fast.mode(fast.mode = `FALSE`, path = "/home/user/filesCSV/")

fast.mode(fast.mode = `TRUE`, path = "/home/user/filesCSV/dataSet.csv")



# `max.people`

This function reads `CSV` files generated by `dfmaker` and select data with a maximum amount of people detected. It must be improve, but right now is useful to select data where only one person has been detected by `OpenPose` which implies the speaker is who makes the gesticulation. The function can read a full folder or only some videos inside the folder when a `CSV` file with the names of wanted videos is provided. 

### Function atributes

max.people(path = "/home/user/dfMakerOutputCSV/", max = 2,full.folder = `TRUE`)

max.people(path = "/home/user/dfMakerOutputCSV/", max = 2,full.folder = `FALSE`,
  files = "/home/user/selectedFiles.csv")
