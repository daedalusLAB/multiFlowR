# multiFlowR

`multiflowR` is a project to develop tools for Quantitative Linguistics (QL) in general and multimodal linguistics in particular.

## postureo.sh

Now there is avalible a bashScript + Rscript to automatizate the process:  [`automation`](https://github.com/daedalusLAB/multiFlowR/tree/main/automation). 

Hope you enjoy! :smiley::smiley::smiley: 


## dfMaker

`dfMaker` is a function that structures data from [`OpenPose`](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) computer vision software for the study of human body language. It also allows to integrate data from filenames if the UCLA tag structure is set to `extra.var= TRUE` (date and searched expression).

> ***Example UCLA's tag structure:*** 2020-02-21_2100_US_CNN_The_Lead_With_Jake_Tapper_1244-1250_subsequently.mp4

dfMaker is not yet fully functional, and the idea is to incorporate data from other software programs to create multimodal 'data frames' in linguistics.

## OpenPoseDataCleaning

This section contains functions to clean and normalize data generated by OpenPose. The idea is to provide tools for computational linguistics studies.

* `xyCorrector`: to set the origin of the coordinates.

* `clipCleaner`: Select dataset with only one speaker and clean up errors in these videos (objects recognised as people).

* `cramerOpenPose`: Standardise data using Cramer's rule
